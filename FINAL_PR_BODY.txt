# Final Submission: PDP + Mini-Cart Experience (14-day)

## Summary

This PR completes the 14-day Product Detail & Mini-Cart Experience project with full frontend and backend implementation. The application features a modern, accessible e-commerce product detail page with integrated shopping cart functionality.

### Features Implemented

**Frontend (Vanilla JS)**
- Product detail page with image carousel and variant selection
- Mini shopping cart with add/remove/update functionality
- Cart persistence using localStorage
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Full keyboard navigation and accessibility features
- API fallback logic for offline/local development
- Defensive error handling and user input validation

**Backend (Flask)**
- RESTful API with product data endpoint (`GET /api/products`)
- Analytics logging endpoint (`POST /api/analytics`)
- CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- Environment-based port configuration
- File-based analytics storage (demo purposes)

**Infrastructure**
- Netlify configuration for frontend deployment
- Heroku/Render Procfile for backend deployment
- Comprehensive documentation and test report template

## Live Demo

- **Frontend:** FRONTEND_URL
- **Backend API:** BACKEND_URL

## How to Run Locally

### Full Stack Setup
```bash
# Backend
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Frontend (new terminal)
python -m http.server 8000
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000/templates/
```

### Frontend Only (fallback mode)
Open `templates/index.html` directly in browser or serve statically.

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:** Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with modular cart management
- **Backend:** Minimal Flask API with file-based persistence
- **Data Flow:** API-first with local JSON fallback
- **Styling:** Mobile-first responsive design
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliant with screen reader support

## Analytics Implementation

Analytics events are logged to `server/analytics.log` in JSON Lines format for demo purposes. Each event includes:
- `event`: Event type (e.g., "page_view", "add_to_cart")
- `payload`: Event data object
- `ts`: Timestamp (milliseconds)

Example log entry:
```json
{"event": "add_to_cart", "payload": {"product_id": "prod-001", "variant": "variant-1"}, "ts": 1703123456789}
```

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `server/app.py` - Flask backend API
- `server/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `Procfile` - Deployment configuration
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify build settings
- `docs/test-report.md` - Test report template

### Modified Files
- `static/js/app.js` - Added API integration, error handling, debounce
- `templates/index.html` - Added accessibility attributes
- `static/css/style.css` - Added placeholder styles
- `README.md` - Updated with full documentation

## Breaking Changes
None - this is a complete implementation from scratch.

## Future Considerations
- Database integration for production use
- User authentication and session management
- Payment processing integration
- Advanced analytics and reporting
